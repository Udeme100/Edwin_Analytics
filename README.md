 Multilinear Regression Analysis on Company Financial Data

This project performs a multilinear regression analysis on a dataset containing financial metrics of five manufacturing companies, including Inventory Turnover Ratio, Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), and Return on Equity (ROE). It also visualizes the relationships between the variables using pairplots and regression plots.

 Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use pandas for data manipulation, statsmodels for performing multilinear regression, and matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization. The primary objective is to determine how variables like Inventory Turnover Ratio, ROA, and ROE affect the Net Profit Margin of the companies.

Dataset

The dataset contains financial data for five companies and includes the following columns:
- Company: The name of the company (A, B, C, D, E).
- Inventory Turnover Ratio: How efficiently the company manages its inventory.
- Net Profit Margin: A measure of profitability (dependent variable).
- ROA: Return on Assets, an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets.
- ROE: Return on Equity, a measure of profitability that calculates how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.

Sample data:

| Company | Inventory Turnover Ratio | Net Profit Margin | ROA | ROE |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----|-----|
| A       | 4                        | 15                | 6   | 18  |
| B       | 2                        | 18                | 26  | 36  |
| C       | 2                        | 13                | 20  | 25  |
| D       | 4                        | 26                | 25  | 50  |
| E       | 4                        | 18                | 1   | 13  |

 Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed, along with the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas statsmodels matplotlib seaborn
```

 Running the Code

1. Clone the Repository:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/<YourRepository>.git
     ```

2. Run the Python Script:
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the `main.py` Python file:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. The script will perform the following tasks:
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform multilinear regression using statsmodels to determine the relationship between independent variables (Inventory Turnover Ratio, ROA, ROE) and the dependent variable (Net Profit Margin).
   - Print the regression model summary (coefficients, R-squared, p-values).
   - Generate and display visualizations of the relationships between variables using seaborn and matplotlib.

## Code Structure

The Python code in this project follows these steps:

1. Import necessary libraries:
   - pandas for data handling, statsmodels for regression, matplotlib & seaborn for plotting.
   
2. Create the dataset:
   - A dictionary with financial metrics for five companies is converted into a pandas DataFrame.

3. Define independent and dependent variables:
   - Independent variables: Inventory Turnover Ratio, ROA, ROE.
   - Dependent variable: Net Profit Margin.

4. Fit the multilinear regression model:
   - Using statsmodelsâ€™ OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) to fit the model and output the regression summary.

5. Visualizations:
   - A pairplot to visualize relationships between all variables.
   - Individual regression plots showing how each independent variable impacts the dependent variable.

Visualization

The project generates several visualizations:
1. Pairplot: Shows relationships between all variables in the dataset.
2. Regression Plots: Illustrates how the independent variables (Inventory Turnover Ratio, ROA, ROE) affect the dependent variable (Net Profit Margin).

Example of a regression plot:
```python
sns.regplot(x='Inventory_Turnover_Ratio', y='Net_Profit_Margin', data=df)
```

These plots help to visually understand the linear relationships between the financial metrics.
